# Process for Adding New Guides
Hi, 

Thank you for contributing to the Open Data Set Repository. There are two different ways to add the current dataset into a markdown version for it to be added into the repository. If you are starting from scratch, it is recommended to use the New Guide Template file as a template for your guide. However, if you already have a guide that is written, that can also be ported over to markdown using its current format to be added to the current repository.

### Configurations for Different Style Types
#### Headings
All main headings should use a heading size of 2. All subheadings should use heading size of 3.

#### Images
All images should be stored in a seperate .img folder and referenced using a ![alt text](/path/to/heading) format
